# Subreddit-Classifier
This is the code for a model I trained on a training set containing comments from four subreddits. The training data contains 19,600 comments which are unclean, containing all sorts of typos and slang. I first cleaned the comments, then applied word2vec to calculate the sum of word vectors for each comment. Then, I used TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find words that are common across each subreddit and relevant to its topic. Taking these common relevant words from each subreddit, I checked if each comment contained any of these words, appending a value of 1 for a word (dimension/feature) if it was present or a value of 0 if it was not. The final vectors have ~390 dimensions (300 from the word2vec representations, and ~90 from the TF-IDF add-on words). Sklearn's Logistic Regression model when trained on this training data, achieved a 78.5% accuracy when classifying comments from the testing set to one of the four subreddits.
