# Subreddit-Classifier
The "Subreddit Classifier.ipynb" contains all the functions needed to run the program.

In order for it to run successfully, you will need to have the following files present in the same directory:
1. The training file:   redditComments_train.jsonlist
2. The testing file:    redditComments_test.jsonlist
3. The file with word2vec vectors:    GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin

The first two are provided in the repository.
The last one is too large to upload here, but can be dowloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit
